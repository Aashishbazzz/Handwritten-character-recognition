# Handwritten-character-recognition

Created a hand written character recognition deep learning model.
I have used the keras module of tensorflow module to train the model.

Actiivation function used for hidden layers is "relu" and for output layer is "sigmoid".
Optimizer used is "adam"
Loss function used is "sparse_categorical_crossentropy"

When 0 hidden layers used accuracy on test data is 92%
When 1 hidden layer is used accuracy on test data is 97%
